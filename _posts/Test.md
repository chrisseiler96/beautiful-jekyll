## One of my favorite math youtubers, 3Blue1Brown, posted a challenge problem from "The Art of Problem Solving" at the end of one of his videos

**"AoPS must choose one of 20 people to send to a tug-of-war tournament. We don't care who we send, as long as we don't send our weakest person.**

**Each Person has a different strength, but we don't know those strengths. We get 10 intramural 10-on-10 matches to determine who we send.
Can we make sure we don't send our weakest person?"**
